pcb reverse engineering  by python and opencv
Expression of reverse engineering steps
1- First, the board image is prepared by scanning the pcb. This is done by methods such as scanning or taking photos on a light screen with decentralized light.
2- Then we transfer the image to the digimizer software after cutting and adjusting the contrast. And we extract its dimensions.
3- In pycharm software and written program, we put the image address in the image input section.
4- Using the drop-down menu in the opened image, reach the desired mask in the image output and then press the ESC button.
5- The output image is saved at the project site.
