pcb reverse engineering  by python and opencv
Expression of reverse engineering steps

First, the board image is prepared by scanning the pcb. This is done by methods such as scanning or taking photos on a light screen with decentralized light.

Then we transfer the image to the digimizer software after cutting and adjusting the contrast. And we extract its dimensions.

In pycharm software and written program, we put the image address in the image input section.

Using the drop-down menu in the opened image, reach the desired mask in the image output and then press the ESC button.

The output image is saved at the project folder.
